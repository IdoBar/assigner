# Introduction
One of the many reasons to conduct genome scans is to have a subset of markers to
conduct assignment analysis. With **assigner** it's easy to test those markers
by using the list of markers under directional selection with the argument 
`whitelist.markers`. 

Another approach to prune the markers and keep only the top markers, 
those giving the best assignment results, is to use the `sampling.method = "ranked`
to conduct the assignment. This section describes some useful tools for 
understanding this alternative approach to keep relevant markers for population assignment.

# Details of the approach
Using `sampling.method = "ranked` will rank the markers based on 
Weir and Cockerham (1984) Fst. 
To reduce the bias introduced by ranking based on Fst (reviewed in Anderson 2010),
use the `thl` and `iteration.method` arguments.
More iterations will provide better estimate and reduce the bias introduced by 
the mixture of samples used inside the training and holdhout set. This is more
important with admixed populations or populations characterized by lower Fst.

To reduce assignment bias introduced by uneven sample size between your groups, 
**assigner** provides 2 addtional arguments: `subsample` and `iteration.subsample`.
Using more iterations will make sure that all potential combinations of individuals
are used and will provide better null distribution for the statistics.

Run an assignment analysis with these arguments. Try without imputations first.


1. Clean your desk and remove the clutter in the global environment
```r
rm(list=ls())
```

1. Load the required libraries
```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
if (!require("reshape2")) install.packages("reshape2")
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("stringr")) install.packages("stringr")
if (!require("stringi")) install.packages("stringi")
if (!require("plyr")) install.packages("plyr")
if (!require("dplyr")) install.packages("dplyr")
if (!require("tidyr")) install.packages("tidyr")
if (!require("readr")) install.packages("readr")
if (!require("purrr")) install.packages("purrr")
if (!require("data.table")) install.packages("data.table")
if (!require("adegenet")) install.packages("adegenet")
if (!require("stackr")) install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr")
if (!require("assigner")) install_github("thierrygosselin/assigner")
#install_gsi_sim(fromSource = TRUE) # if assigner was re-installed, uncomment and run
```


1. The first tool we'll use is `assigner::import_subsamples_fst`. 
This function imports all the fst files used during the iteration process of `thl`,
for all the subsamples:
```r
# Get the folder containing the data:
https://github.com/thierrygosselin/package_data/raw/master/top_markers_assignment.tar.gz
# change the path below to reflect the directory
top.fst <- import_subsamples_fst(dir.path = "~/Downloads/top_markers_assignment")
```

1. We will use `dplyr` verbs to filer the huge data frame. Here, we will keep
only the top 500 ranked in every iterations and subsamples. 
I chose this number, because based on the plot, not much gain in power is obtained
by using more markers with this dataset:
```r
top.fst.select <- top.fst %>% 
filter(RANKING <= 500)
```

1. Here, we want to keep only the markers that are systematically found in 
the top 500, independantly of the subsample and the iterations... 
i.e. independant of individual composition/mixture at the subsample level and 
at the thl level.
```r
top.fst.select.count <- top.fst.select %>% 
group_by(MARKERS) %>% 
tally %>% 
arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
mutate(RANKING = seq(from = 1, to = n())) %>% 
filter(RANKING <= 500)
```

4. From this we can build a whitelist of markers:
```r
whitelist.top.500.markers <- top.fst.select.count %>% 
select(MARKERS) %>% 
separate(col = MARKERS, into = c("CHROM", "LOCUS", "POS"), sep = "_")
whitelist.top.500.markers <- plyr::colwise(as.integer)(whitelist.top.500.markers)
# To write to the working directory:
write_tsv(x = whitelist.top.500.markers, path = "whitelist.top.500.markers.tsv", col_names = TRUE)
```

# Conclusion
In short, you now have a whitelist of markers that will give you the best overall
assignment results.

Optimal assignment are more likely for these reasons:

* the markers were crafted using the Training, Holdout, Leave-one-out approach

* individuals were bootstrap with resampling using the iteration argument inside 
the training/holdout sets

* reduce bias is expected if populations have unequal sample size because the 
subsample argument and bootstrap with resampling was used to level the number 
of individuals per populations

* using supplementary individuals will certainly highlight that you have done your homework
